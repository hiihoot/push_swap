# Push Swap

## Description
**Push Swap** is an algorithmic project that challenges students to sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions and a second auxiliary stack. The goal is to find the most efficient sequence of operations to achieve a fully sorted state.

## Instructions

### Compilation
The project uses a `Makefile` to manage compilation. To build the programs, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# To compile the push_swap program
make
```

## Execution

To run the sorting program:

```Bash

./push_swap 3 2 1 6 5
```


Cleaning
```Bash

make clean    # Removes object files
make fclean   # Removes object files and binaries
make re       # Recompiles the entire project
```
